## Help us build the metaverse

Decentraland is a platform made up of multiple services that interact with each other. This site gathers the documentation for each of them in one single place.

Decentraland is developed as an open source project, and welcomes any contributions from the community. Each of these projects includes documentation about how you can run your own instances and ultimately contribute to keep expanding the project.
